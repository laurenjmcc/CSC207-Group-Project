# User stories:
1. Fatima wants to create an account and use our software. First, she runs the program. Next, she clicks the “Create account” button. She will input a string username and password in the corresponding text box input places. If her username or password to not match the criteria required (invalid string, too long, etc), then she will be prompted to input a new username and password. Otherwise, the account will be created and her account will be created. Now, to use our software, all she has to do is login with the account she created and begin. (Arhan's user story) 
2. Alice is a biologist who wants to study the effect of a specific mutation on protein stability. She runs the program on her computer and before she enters the protein sequence  in the “Protein Sequence” input text area it’s confirmed that the protein exists, if not raise an error. Then she enters the mutation in the “Mutation” input text area. She clicks a button on the interface to analyze the data, and her results appear in a pop up window. (Haroon's user story)
3. Tim wants to learn more about the results of his inputs. He runs the program on his computer and enters the protein sequence in the “Protein Sequence” input text area. Then she enters the mutation in the “Mutation” input text area. She clicks a button on the interface to analyze the data, and her results appear in a pop up window. Bob clicks a button and he is sent to a link which provides him more information about his inputted protein or mutation. (Team Use Case)
4. Bob has used our software before, and wants to access his past results. He runs the program, and clicks login. He inputs his user and password in the provided text boxes. Then, he clicks a button for past results. Then, it gives Bob a pop-up window with all of the past results he has received on that account. (Sara's user story)
5. Tim and Tom are working on biological research together, and want to have access to the same results. Tom creates a team by clicking create team and inputting both Tim and Tom's username. Then, Tom uses the software to analyze a protein mutation and gets a result. Now, when Tim goes to see his past results, we will see Tom’s result that he created in the team as well.
