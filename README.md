# User stories:
1. Alice is a biologist who wants to study the effect of a specific mutation on protein stability. She runs the program on her computer and enters the protein sequence in the “Protein Sequence” input text area. Then she enters the mutation in the “Mutation” input text area. She clicks a button on the interface to analyze the data, and her results appear in a pop up window. (TEAM MEMBER?)
2. Martin is focused on studying single point mutations in a protein, specifically examining how a single amino acid substitution at the sequence level can lead to localized atomic changes in the 3D structure, impacting the protein’s folding kinetics, stability, flexibility, and dynamics. To proceed, Martin inputs a text string into the “Single Mutation” textbox, specifying the mutation with a 1-letter code for the wild-type residue, the residue position, and a 1-letter code for the mutant residue. After clicking the “Run” button, a results page opens, displaying the Gibbs free energy values associated with the mutation and providing interpretations of these values.(TEAM MEMBER?)
3. Mina is a biologist who wants to run a test on a protein using multiple mutations. She runs the program on her computer and enters the protein sequence in the “Protein Sequence” input text area. Then she enters multiple mutations in the “Mutation” input text area. She clicks a button on the interface to analyze the data, and her results appear in a pop up window, where she can see a unique section of the result for each mutation.(TEAM MEMBER?)
4. Tim wants to learn more about the results of his inputs. He runs the program on his computer and enters the protein sequence in the “Protein Sequence” input text area. Then she enters the mutation in the “Mutation” input text area. She clicks a button on the interface to analyze the data, and her results appear in a pop up window. Bob clicks a button and he is sent to a link which provides him more information about his inputted protein or mutation.(TEAM MEMBER?)
5. Bob has used our software before, and wants to access his past results. He runs the program, and clicks login. He inputs his user and password in the provided text boxes. Then, he clicks a button for past results. Then, it gives Bob a pop-up window with all of the past results he has received on that account.(TEAM MEMBER?)
