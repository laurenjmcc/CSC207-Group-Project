# Project Summary
  Our project is a Java Application with a graphical user interface that allows users to input protein sequences, and interact with the Proteins API (cited below) to give you a description of the protein, and predict mutations in the given sequence. Our program allows for users to sign up and log in, as well as view past results. You can also create a team with multiple users, so that when one person on your team analyzes a protein, every user in the team can see those results. 

# User stories:
1. Fatima wants to create an account and use our software. First, she runs the program. Next, she clicks the “Create account” button. She will input a string username and password in the corresponding text box input places. If  the username or password already exists it will raise an error then she will be prompted to input a new username and password. Otherwise, the account will be created. Now, to use our software, she has to login with the account she created and begin. (Sara's user story) 
2. Alice is a biologist who wants to study the effect of a specific mutation on a protein . She runs the program on her computer and enters the protein sequence  in the “Protein Sequence” input text area it’s confirmed that the protein exists, if not it will raise an error. She clicks a button on the interface to analyze the data, and the description of the protein sequence she entered will appear. (Arhan's user story)
3. Bob has used our software before, and wants to access his past results. He logs in, then he clicks a button for past results. It gives Bob a pop-up window with all of the past results he has received on that account.(Haroon's user story)
4. Tim and Tom are working on biological research together, and want to have access to the same results. Tom creates a team by clicking create team and inputting both Tim and Tom's username. Then, Tom uses the software to analyze a protein mutation and gets a result. Now, when Tim goes to see his past results, we will see Tom’s result that he created in the team as well. (Lauren's user story)
5. Tim wants to learn more about the results of his inputs. He runs the program on his computer and enters the protein sequence in the “Protein Sequence” input text area. She clicks the “Analyze” button on the interface then clicks on the “Disease” button, all the disease corresponding to that protein  appear in a pop up window. She can  also views the protein structure by pressing on the “Structure” button. Bob clicks a button and he is sent to a link which provides him more information about his inputted protein.(Team Use Case)
